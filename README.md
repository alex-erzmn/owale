# owale
Based on the course "AI Game Programming" by J.-C. RÃ©gin, this version of the Owale game was created to experience implementing AI for two player games using the Minimax-Algorithm.

## How to play
The application can be started by executing the Main class in your preferred IDE or by running the .jar file. 

At first, you will be asked to insert a number between 1 and 3 to choose whether you want to play against the AI and who should start (1 or 2)
or let the AI play against itself (3).

If you choose to play against the AI, you can make your move by entering a move in the following format:
B / R + hole number (e.g. B1 or R12)

Enjoy!
