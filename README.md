# owale
Based on the course "AI Game Programming" by J.-C. RÃ©gin, this version of the Owale game was created to experience implementing AI for two player games using the Minimax-Algorithm.

## TODO:

### Optimizing the AI
- [ ] Optimizing Minimax-Algorithm using Alpha-Beta-Pruning
- [ ] Implementing Iterative Deepening
- [ ] Examine the possible depth within a turn time limit of 2sec
- [ ] Implement safety mechanism to stop computing after 2sec and return the best move so far
- [ ] FIX: int bestMove = -1;

### Optimizing Interface and Game
- [ ] Make sure the rules are applied correctly 
- [ ] Having flexible Interface to connect second AI or Player
- [ ] Adding display for the time spend to determine a turn
- [ ] Adding display for the depth of the Minimax-Algorithm
- [ ] Separating the two turns such that one can see who did a turn
